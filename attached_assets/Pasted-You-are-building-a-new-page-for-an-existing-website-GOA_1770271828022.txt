You are building a new page for an existing website.

GOAL
Create a clean, professional “Company Policies” page for BlastProjects, accessible at:
- Route: /policies
- URL: https://blastprojects.com/policies

IMPORTANT
- Do NOT add this page to the top header / main navigation.
- It’s OK to add it in the footer as a small link labeled “Policies”.
- Keep the design consistent with the existing BlastProjects site (fonts, spacing, colors, layout).
- Make it responsive and readable (mobile-friendly).
- The page should be simple, modern, and trustworthy.

PAGE CONTENT (copy exactly, you can adjust formatting but not meaning)
Title: Company Policies
Brand: BlastProjects
Last updated: February 2026

Sections:

1) Workplace Policy
BlastProjects is a remote-first software development studio.
We operate with flexibility, trust, and accountability, focusing on outcomes rather than rigid schedules or locations. Team members collaborate across time zones using modern tools and clear communication to deliver high-quality work efficiently and responsibly.

2) Confidentiality & Client Work
All client projects, discussions, designs, and deliverables are treated as strictly confidential.
BlastProjects respects non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) and confidentiality obligations. We do not share, reuse, or disclose client information, intellectual property, or materials without explicit permission.

3) Security & Data Responsibility
We take reasonable measures to protect project data and access, including:
- Secure authentication and access controls
- Trusted development and collaboration tools
- Principle-of-least-access for internal systems
While no system is immune to risk, we are committed to responsible data handling and continuous improvement of security practices.

4) Intellectual Property
Unless otherwise agreed in writing:
- Client-owned work remains the property of the client upon completion and payment
- BlastProjects retains the right to showcase non-confidential work for portfolio or marketing purposes
Any deviations from this are documented contractually.

5) Professional Conduct
BlastProjects is committed to respectful, ethical, and professional collaboration.
We do not tolerate harassment, discrimination, misuse of data, or unethical behavior in any form. We aim to build long-term relationships based on transparency, trust, and mutual respect.

6) Changes to These Policies
BlastProjects may update these policies periodically to reflect changes in operations, legal requirements, or best practices. Updates will be posted on this page with a revised “Last updated” date.

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
- Use a simple layout: centered container, max-width ~800–900px.
- Add clear typography hierarchy: H1 for title, H2 for section headings.
- Add subtle dividers between sections.
- Add a small “Last updated: February 2026” line under the title.
- Provide good line-height and spacing.
- Include a “Back to Home” or “Return to site” link at the top or bottom (optional).

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS
- Implement as a real page/route in the existing stack (React/Next/Remix/etc. depending on the repo).
- Ensure it is reachable at /policies.
- Add a footer link labeled “Policies” that points to /policies, but do not add anything to the header.
- If the project has a router, add the route.
- If the project uses file-based routing (like Next.js), create the correct file (e.g., pages/policies.tsx or app/policies/page.tsx).
- Do not break existing routes/components.

OUTPUT
- Create the page and route, and confirm which files you changed/added.
- Keep code clean and consistent with the codebase conventions.

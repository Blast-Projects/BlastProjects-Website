IMPORTANT CONTEXT:

- Pre-launch status
- Waitlist / early access positioning
- Clear problem → solution narrative
- Vision and roadmap instead of results
- Credibility without exaggeration

TONE:
- Professional
- Confident but honest
- Founder-led startup
- Modern SaaS language
- No hype, no lies

### HEADER / STATUS
Replace any “Live” indicators with:
“Waitlist Open” or “Early Access”

### PRODUCT NAME
SnapTagSync

### OVERVIEW (Rewrite this section)

SnapTagSync is a next-generation photo capture, organization, and synchronization platform designed for teams and individuals who need structured, reliable photo workflows across devices.

Built for real-world operations — from industrial teams to growing organizations — SnapTagSync focuses on making photo capture smarter, searchable, and securely organized from the moment a photo is taken.

SnapTagSync is currently in private development with early access available via waitlist.

---

### THE PROBLEM (Rewrite)

Photos are everywhere — phones, tablets, shared drives, cloud folders — but managing them across teams and devices quickly becomes chaotic.

Files get duplicated, lost, mislabeled, or buried in personal photo libraries. Critical images lack context, metadata, or structure, making them difficult to find when they matter most.

Existing solutions are either consumer-focused, expensive, or not designed for structured, team-based workflows.

---

### THE SOLUTION (Rewrite)

SnapTagSync is being built to solve this by providing a structured, metadata-driven photo workflow.

The platform enables users to capture photos with purpose — automatically attaching tags, context, and organization at the source — while syncing securely across devices and cloud storage.

The goal is simple:
Make every photo easy to capture, easy to find, and easy to trust.
